    "A stride incorporates two steps, the left and the right. Stride length is therefore actually double the step length (assuming the left step is more or less the same as the right step). In other words, stride length is the distance covered between initial contact (IC) of one foot and the consecutive IC of that same foot.\n",

    "On average, adults have a step length of about 2.2 to 2.5 feet. In general, if you divide a person's step length by their height, the ratio value you get is about 0.4 (with a range from about 0.41 to 0.45).[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-estimating-height-walk/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20adults%20have%20a,from%20about%200.41%20to%200.45)]\n",

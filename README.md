# Programming for Data Analysis Project
## Simulate a data set of a real-world phenomenon

The document `ProgDAProject.pdf` contains the instructions fo this project. We were to hit on four key points:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Using `NumPy` and measurements I researched I simulated data of 100 runners. My four parameters were:

1. Average weekly distance ran in training.
2. Average training pace.
3. Race day pace.
4. Finishing times.

On further study I would like to gain a large data set. The studies used as a reference in this report rarely had more the 30 runners. I would preform predictive analysis using 1 and 2 above to predict 3. Then use 3 to determine 4.
